**Loop One is an open-source design that aims to alleviate thermal discomfort among wheelchair users. With water looping through the wheelchairâ€™s cushion and a Peltier module pumping heat in the required direction, the user can control whether their chair should warm up or cool down. This is important as regulating the seat temperature can minimise the risk of pressure sores.**
